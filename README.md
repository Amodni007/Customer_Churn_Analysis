#  Customer Churn Analysis Project : Using Excel, SQL, and Python
This project explores customer churn behavior using a telecom dataset. The aim is to understand why customers leave and help businesses reduce churn. It combines Excel, SQL, and Python for a complete data analysis workflow.

##  Excel Work : Data Cleaning + Basic EDA

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removed empty rows and duplicate entries
  - Fixed column formats (e.g., `TotalCharges` as numeric)
  - Saved clean versions in `.xlsx` and `.csv`

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Created PivotTables:
    - Churn by Gender
    - Churn by Contract Type
    - Churn by Payment Method
  - Added conditional formatting and grouped tenure

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Bar and pie charts to show churn trends
  - All charts moved to a `Charts` sheet in Excel

##  SQL Analysis : Querying the Cleaned Data

 Tool Used: [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)

- **Imported the clean dataset** into a SQLite database as a table `telco_customers`
- **Explored data structure** using:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM telco_customers LIMIT 10;
  PRAGMA table_info(telco_customers);


 ## Python â€“ Visualization + Optional Modeling
